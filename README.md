# EUS Wiki Guide

IN THE BEGINNING there was an EUS. And then there wasn't for a couple of years. And now there's one again. To ensure this does not happen again, the EUS Board of Governors thought it would be a good idea to create a guide on using the wiki. This guide includes information on how to set up the wiki in case the instance is destroyed for some reason, how to perfom maintenance on the wiki, as well as any additional notes the author found pertinent.
